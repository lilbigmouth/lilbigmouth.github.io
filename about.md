title: About Me

Welcome to my blog!

I became a professional software developer in 2018, shortly after completing a Bachelor of Science in Computing and IT.

I work on a Windows desktop application for the retail industry in the UK. This uses Java with the JavaFX framework and a SQLite database mapped by an ORM library.
I have recently been exposed to using Typescript with React for a new application we have created too.

I have created this blog to occasionally share my experiences with Java coding but also challenges with technology in general.
